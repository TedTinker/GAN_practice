# GAN_practice
I made a generative adversarial network for my YouTube channel, Thinkstr.

To use this yourself, you'll need the required packages, including tensorflow, numpy, and matplotlib.
I recommend using tensorflow integrated with your GPU.

You'll also need to create a folder called "history" where you store these files, into which generated images will be saved,
and change my file-path to your own.
